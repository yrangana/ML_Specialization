    "Now let's try the Random Forest algorithm also, using the Scikit-learn implementation. Naturally, all of the above hyperparameters will exist in this algorithm, since it is just an ensemble of Decision Trees, but will have another hyperparameter that you will use, called `n_estimators` which is how many different Decision Trees will be fitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that for a Random Forest, you use a subset of the features AND a subset of the training set to train each tree, chosen randomly. In this case, you will use the number of features as you saw in the lecture, which is $\\sqrt{n}$ where $n$ is the number of features. However, this can be modified. For further information on the Random Forest hyperparameters, you can run `help(RandomForestClassifier)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another parameter that does not impact on the final result but can speed up the computation is called `n_jobs`. Since the fitting of each tree is independent of each other, it is possible to run parallel fits. So setting `n_jobs` higher will increase how many CPU cores it will use. Note that the numbers very close to the maximum cores of your CPU may impact on the overall performance of your PC and even lead to freezes. \n",

    "You have demonstrated how to look for the best value hyperparameter-by-hyperparameter. However, you should not overlook that as we experiment with one hyperparameter we always have to fix the others at some default values. This makes us only able to tell how the hyperparameter value changes with respect to those defaults. In princple, if you have 4 values to try out in each of the 3 hyperparameters being tuned, you should have a total of 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 combinations, however, the way you are doing will only give us 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 results. To try out all combinations, you can use a sklearn implementation called GridSearchCV, moreover, it has a refit parameter that will automatically refit a model on the best combination so you will not need to program it explicitly. For more on GridSearchCV, please refer to its [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)."

This is how we can automatically control how many estimators is enough, and how we can avoid overfitting due to too many estimators.\n",
